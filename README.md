# Temporal Data Store

An in-memory data store service.

The data store holds 'observations' for a given identifier (e.g. financial instrument) for a given timestamp including some data. 

Allows multiple clients to update and query using simple commands (see Main class).

This started off as a simple programming exercise and the idea is to evolve it into a simulated stock exchange.
